I'm a full-stack web developer with years of experience under my belt (working as a software developer since 2015). I’ve got a proven experience in developing a good range of web applications using JavaScript (Node.js, React), MongoDB, ASP.NET (MVC, Web API), MSSQL, and HTML5/CSS3, including web applications for startup companies, small businesses, and individuals. I’ve got a software engineering background (algorithms, data structures, OO design patterns and practices), knowledge of architecture planning, and scaling.

I do my best to transform your ideas into an ideal software product. I can facilitate you or your business create a website/web application from design concept to a completed, polished, and professional site. Apps that perform well in search, load super-fast, and are secure, all while providing a pleasing experience for the user. I can even help maintain and update existing web applications.

Choose to work with me and you'll get reliability, quality, and satisfaction. I deliver perfect results, meet deadlines, follow instructions. I pride myself on making my clients very happy and exceeding their needs. My goal is to create long-lasting relationships, not quick one-time transactions.

I even have lots of experience with teamwork, so I'm well aware of team workflow and methodologies/tools used for that.
